    "text": "1.1 Background\nAssociation football, also known as soccer, is a game played by two teams of 11 players each. Teams compete by advancing a ball into their opponent’s goal, adhering to established rules that govern gameplay, player conduct, and scoring, with the aim to score more goals than their rivals (Memmert and Raabe 2018; Sumpter 2016). Although the fundamental simplicity of football contributes significantly to its global popularity and appeal, the game simultaneously possesses incredible complexity characterised by movement patterns, match plans, playing philosophies, and creativity (Bornn, Cervone, and Fernandez 2018; Vicente et al. 2024). These qualities are collectively referred to as football tactics (Memmert and Raabe 2018).\nFootball tactics involve strategically positioning players on the field and co-ordinating their movements to maximise the chances of winning matches. This encompasses both the formation that a team adopts (that is, the spatial arrangement of players on the pitch) and their overall style of play (Wilson 2010). Furthermore, Rein and Memmert (2016) describe football tactics as the actions and strategies implemented by a team and its players during a match to achieve specific goals, primarily winning the game. These actions are typically adaptations to dynamically-changing situations in the match and the behaviour of the opposing team, managing space, time, and individual actions on the pitch.\nFundamental to understanding these tactical deployments are the distinct player positions and the common tactical formations they operate within.
