I also extend my thanks to my family, colleagues at Allan Gray, and friends for their unwavering encouragement and understanding. Their support has been a constant source of motivation. Special thanks to my sister, Karen, and friends like Emily, Mark, Emmanuel (Manu), Asanda, and Ron for their emotional check-ins and shared moments that helped navigate the challenges of this academic journey.
